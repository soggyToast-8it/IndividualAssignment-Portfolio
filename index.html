                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hello ! I'm a Bsc. in Computing student, studying to become a Software Engineer. I studied animation for two years but inevitably changed courses as animation felt more like a hobby to me.</p>
                    <p>I used to teach myself basic HTML on <a href="https:\\neocities.org/browse" target="_blank">neocities.org</a> when i was younger, but now, due to a lack of practice, I'm kind of rusty in that aspect and decided to teach myself Korean; my biggest goal in life is to work/study in South Korea. However, taking Web Programming has reignited the spark of learning how to build a website, so I hope to learn many more things during my time.</p>

                        <p><b>Chapter 4 - Achieve Your Goals: Charlie explains how important it is to develop and accomplish goals. He tells Michael that goals provide direction and meaning. Setting both short-term and long-term goals, while periodically reviewing and changing them are important. </p>
                        <p>Chapter 5 - The Proper Use of Time: The sixth pillar, Time Management, and the idea that one's priorities are reflected in their time management are presented to Michael by Charlie. He emphasizes the significance of time management by emphasizing time control. Since time cannot be earned, he suggests being careful of how each day is spent. </p>
                        <p>Chapter 6 - Surround Yourself With the Best People: Charlie tells Michael that one of the most important aspects of success is surrounding yourself with the right people. One's life can be made better or worse by the people in it. Being among people who support growth, push them to be better, and have a positive influence is therefore essential. </p>
                        <p>Chapter 7 - Be a Life-Long Learner: Charlie urges Michael to be a life-long learner. He explains that learning can have both positive and negative effects. You develop when you learn, but you lose when you don't. Real learning is a lifelong process; formal schooling is not the end of education. Michael is encouraged by Charlie to read books and to constantly broaden his horizons. </p>

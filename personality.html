                        <p class="th-desc">Drawing has been a great passion of mine for as long as I can remember. As much as I hate to admit it, my love for drawing has me spending prolonged hours of the days on just that. On the other hand drawing has fueled my creativity, and helps me in my school life by letting my creativity reveal who I am.</p>

                        <p class="th-desc">Gaming is another time-consuming hobby of mine. It may be a big distraction, but without it my interest in programming would not be as high as it is now. The first time I found out a game ran on codes written by a person, I had a dream of either being, at the very least, a game developer or a programmer.</p>

                        <p class="th-desc">I'm not a very talkative person, nor am I a person with much emotional intellegence, but I'm a very supportive person. I enjoy supporting my peers or strangers in their endeavors if it means they will gain courage or motivation to successfully complete their tasks.</p>

                    <p class="hero-qm"><em>"It may be hard now, but after going through it, it will become good memory"</em></p>
                    <p class="hero-background"> Park Seong Hwa [pronounced sung-wa] is a South Korean singer and member of the boy group ATEEZ. He is seen as a figure of guidance by his peers and fans, with his first name roughly translating to "To be a star". 성/Seong meaning 'star' and 화/Hwa meaning 'become'. </p>
                    <p class="hero-background">The quote chosen highlights how he isn't afraid of stressful moments, as he understands life isn't always easy for those who work hard. Seonghwa is a person I look up to, because even as a famous idol he understands the harshness of life as any other person. His humbleness towards his success always reminds me that he is also just a person working just as hard as any person, even if it looks easy.</p>

                    <h2 class="rep-title">AI Business Ideas Report</h2>
                    <p class="rep-body">Artificial Intelligence is being used to help with repetitive and time-consuming tasks like scheduling, or writing E-mails.<br/><br/> In my life as a University student, the idea of AI is somewhat helpful for me. During finals, studying weeks worth of notes can be very overwhelming. An AI-based productivity tool would help me summarize my notes, and even create questions to practice when there's a scarcity of resources to use as practice. <br/><br/> One major ethical concern is privacy. The amount of personal information that is gathered by AI productivity tools raises questions on how this data is stored, and who has access to it. Another concern is over-reliance. There is concern that humans are too reliant on AI tools; relying on the AI to make decisions and manage their plans, humans will lose the ability think on their own. </p>

                            <h3>Solution</h3>
                            <p>A solution to these problems would be to have the tool be developed with full transparency, and allow the users the right to delete any collected data as they please. The other is to have the AI tool be developed only as a helper, every decision must be confirmed by the user.</p>

                            <p>An example of this is Notion AI. The <a href="https://notion.com" target="_blank">Notion</a> app is very popular among students. Notion AI is a user productivity tool that employs AI to assist users in writing, summarizing, and organizing their notes and tasks in one place.</p>
